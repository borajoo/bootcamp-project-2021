        sesame mochi bread is a Korean bread with a mild taste and chewy
        texture. they are sometimes called dino eggs because of their speckled
        appearance. these are my favorite snack breads when I go to a Korean
        bakery :)

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>35 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>130 grams tapioca flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tablespoon black sesame seed, toasted</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and prepare a sheet pan lined with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, combine the milk, butter, sugar, and salt. Bring it to a
        simmer over medium heat while stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the mixture comes to a simmer, take it off the heat and stir in the
        vanilla. Immediately sift in the 35 grams of all-purpose flour and whisk
        the mixture until it thickens to a baby food consistency and becomes as
        smooth as possible. Some small lumps are okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the all-purpose flour have been incorporated, add the tapioca
        flour and fold everything together until no more dry flour is visible.
        The dough will become quite stiff and thick. Let the dough cool until
        it's warm to the touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the dough has cooled, add the beaten egg in 3 additions and
        incorporate the egg completely with a spatula before adding the next.
        After each addition of eggs, check the consistency of the dough. A
        proper dough will flow slowly like thick batter, looks slightly
        translucent, and forms a triangular shape when it breaks off.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pipe the dough out into a 1Â½ inch wide dome, about 1 inch in height.
        Keep each piping about 1 inch apart to accommodate for some puffing up
        when baking. Dip your finger into some cold water and dab the tips of
        each dough dome to round it off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the mochi breads for about 25 to 30 minutes or until it turns
        slightly golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes and enjoy!
