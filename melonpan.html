    <h3>instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the cookie dough by placing the butter and sugar in a large bowl
        and beat until light and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>Add the egg and vanilla essence and mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>Fold through the flour and baking powder.</li>
      <li>
        Divide the cookie dough into 8 small balls and set aside in the fridge.
      </li>
      <li>Combine egg, yeast, milk and sugar in a small bowl or jug.</li>
      <li>Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the centre of the flour and add the liquid mixture and
        stir to form a soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead for
        about 10 min or until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the mixer motor running, add the chopped butter until the butter is
        combined and a smooth and silky dough forms (about a further 10
        minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover and set aside in a warm
        place to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the bread dough into 8 equal sized balls and knead on a lightly
        floured surface until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the refrigerated cookie dough on cling wrap to 5mm thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once it is rolled place one bread dough on top of one cookie dough ball
        and wrap together using cling wrap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the cling wrap off and score the cookie dough surface diagonally
        and sprinkle the granule sugar.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat for all 8 bread rolls.</li>
      <li>
        Place them on a cooking paper lined oven tray and cover with clean damp
        cloth and set aside for about 40 min or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 356 f and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
