        tiramisu is a coffee flavored Italian dessert that has a soft texture!
        it goes well with tea. i love to get tiramisu because I like the
        slightly bitter taste as compared to an overwhelmingly sweet dessert.

    <h3>instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and
        1/4 cup sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A
        slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when
        lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the
        medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining 1/4 cup sugar until it
        creates soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it
        creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the
        mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.
      </li>
      <li>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch
        dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon
        cocoa powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso
        mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the
        liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the
        baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an
        even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any
        obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the
        mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with
        remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with
        shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4
        hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better) before slicing or
        scooping to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
